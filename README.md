# An Analyisis of Kickstarter Campaigns
This project analyzed Kickstarter data to provide insight into crowdfunding and producing plays.

## Findings
In this analysis, theatre was shown to be a popular category on Kickstarter. Of the ~900 instances of posted theatre projects on Kickstarter ~500 were successfully funded.

Looking at the success rates by the month projects were posted on Kickstarter, December was the only month where failures outpaced successes. However, the most successful times to launch a project were May and June.

A large role in the success or failure of US-based plays on Kickstarter was the *initial goal*. The mean goal of failed play projects was ~$10,500 - around twice the mean of successful plays (~$5,050). Of note, this data was skewed right, with the medians of successful and failed play project being about $3,000 and $5,000, respectively. This implies the existence of outliers, that is, US plays with funding goals that far exceeded the 'normal' range of values. 

This trend was also true of the amounts *pledged* to successful and failed US plays. The mean amount pledged to successful plays was ~$5,600, while the median amount pledged was lower at ~$3,200. This implies that US play projects with lower goals are more often funded. Of consideration in this aspect is the IQR of pledges to successful projects, which was ~$4,000.

## Conclusions
From this analysis, if Louise wants to increase her chances of successfully funding her play within the US, she should launch her project on Kickstarter in May or June. Further, she should plan to set her goal to $4,000 or less.
