# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project analyzed Kickstarter data to provide insight into crowdfunding and producing plays.

### Purpose
Our friend Louise created a play and wanted to know the best conditions and ways for her to successfully fund it. By analyzing Kickstarter data on projects' goals, pledges, and launch dates, we have produced this report outlining criteria she can use to increase her chances of successfully funding her play.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
We found that theater projects were most successfully funded during the months of May and June, with 111 and 100 projects funded respectively. The amount of successfully funded theater projects tapers off throughout the rest of year when in December the number of projects that met their funding goals and failed their funding goals are about equal. ![Theater Outcomes by Launch Date](https://github.com/bromul/kickstarter-analysis/blob/main/Resources/Theater_Outcomes_vs_Launch.png)

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs we could create?
